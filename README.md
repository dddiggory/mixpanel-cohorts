This is a free, unofficial service for easily converting a filtered set of Mixpanel user profiles into a saved ad hoc cohort, accessible in both your Engagement reports (e.g., Segmentation, Funnels, Retention) and for easy Notification targeting (i.e., saving a complex set of filters and using them for many different Notifications). 

This tool supports both one-time groupings from the Explore tab and recurring checks via the Notifications tab. Note that while Webhooks are categorized as Notifications in Mixpanel, they do not trigger any communications to users themselves. This tool will not communicate with your users, and will not store your user data.
